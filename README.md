### Now deployed to the IPFS network!  [here](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVh1oi9fQs6KnhvbVSFoCpWmywdBzWAmGAcu3YzN89C8p/)  ðŸ›°
Important note: please help this application to be alive by loading `http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmVh1oi9fQs6KnhvbVSFoCpWmywdBzWAmGAcu3YzN89C8p` on your local node.



A simple and tested web application built in React that lets you
calculate how much money you will save per year by using taking advantadge of your company benefits in a monthly basis

This model is based in the **IRPF tax model of 2017 from Spain**.

### Architecture
- The frontend application is build using React + Redux and tested using the [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) testing library by Airbnb.
- The web application requests the yearly savings value to an scalable WebSockets API built with [SocketCluster](https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster)

### Deployment

**Frontend**

The frontend, the web application has been deployed to  IPFS, the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io) ðŸŒŽ

It can be accessed [here](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVh1oi9fQs6KnhvbVSFoCpWmywdBzWAmGAcu3YzN89C8p/)

This means the website is not deployed to a simple single point of failure web server, but deployed to a decentralized structure of multiple nodes that host the data.

If you'd like to support this app, feel free to deploy a node on your local machine and load the following hash: QmVh1oi9fQs6KnhvbVSFoCpWmywdBzWAmGAcu3YzN89C8p

This will help the app to live forever in the network without any cost.

**Backend**

As for the backend application, it still needs to be deployed to a decentralized network such as Ethereum, EOS or many others.
I'm im the process of doing it but it still will require some time.
